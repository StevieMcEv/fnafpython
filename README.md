# FNAF : Python
A terminal-based version of Five Nights at Freddy's being played by the famous YouTuber Markiplier written in Python.
This is a simple interpretation of the original FNAF being played by Markiplier who reactes to events in the game just like he does in a video.
The entire game runs through the terminal.

This is a very simple program. Mark always wins no matter what.
